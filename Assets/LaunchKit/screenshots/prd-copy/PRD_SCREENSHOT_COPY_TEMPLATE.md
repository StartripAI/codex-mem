- Surface:
- User story:
- Pain point:
- Value promise:
- Primary metric:
- Secondary metric:

## Block A - Hero Screenshot (GitHub First Screen)

- Title (6-10 words):
  - `Persistent Memory for Codex Workflows`
- Subtitle (12-22 words):
  - `Progressive retrieval keeps context precise, while local-first storage preserves continuity across sessions.`
- Caption (1 sentence):
  - `This view shows lifecycle capture, retrieval layers, and fused memory+code context in one operational loop.`
- Annotation callouts:
  1. `Layer 1 compact search`
  2. `Layer 2 timeline context`
  3. `Layer 3 full detail`
  4. `Token-aware retrieval`

## Block B - Feature Screenshot (mem-search)

- Title:
  - `Ask Memory in Natural Language`
- Problem:
  - `Engineers lose time replaying prior work history.`
- Outcome:
  - `Natural language query resolves relevant work records with time-intent parsing.`
- KPI text:
  - `Time to relevant context: <30s`

## Block C - Feature Screenshot (Privacy Controls)

- Title:
  - `Dual-Tag Privacy by Design`
- Problem:
  - `Sensitive outputs should not leak into default recall.`
- Outcome:
  - `Semantic tags classify context; privacy tags control write, visibility, and redaction.`
- KPI text:
  - `Default recall excludes private records`

## Block D - Feature Screenshot (Stable/Beta Runtime)

- Title:
  - `Switch Runtime Behavior in Seconds`
- Problem:
  - `Teams need predictable stable mode and experimental beta mode.`
- Outcome:
  - `Stable for explicit controls, beta endless mode for aggressive output compaction.`
- KPI text:
  - `One-command config switch`

## CTA Copy Set

- CTA 1: `Install in 2 minutes`
- CTA 2: `Run smoke test now`
- CTA 3: `Start with mem-search`

## Alt Text Template

- `Screenshot of <surface>, highlighting <key capability> with <user outcome>.`

## Review Checklist

- No personal names, machine paths, account IDs, or keys
- Text is outcome-first, not implementation-first
- One screenshot communicates one core message
- Caption and annotation terms match product vocabulary in README
